Writing Gym
===========

Not too long ago, I was discussing that well-known academic saw of "publish
or perish" with a seasoned bioinformatician. I was bemoaning my feelings
of poor progress in my PhD, and pointed out that I often don't feel like
I have results ready to write up.

My friend (who is real---this isn't *Rich Dad, Poor Dad*) observed that
publications are in fact not something we have any control over. Once a
piece of writing lands in the lap of some publisher, all we know is it
might be accepted with some probability. It is pretty much out of our
our hands as of that moment. And some pretty bad writing gets accepted
sometimes, so you don't need to be a perfectionist with your submissions.
If the reviewers have a problem, they'll let you know, so why not just unleash
your crappy writing on them and hope for the best?

Although we don't have control over publishers and reviewers, we do have
control over how much we write. So our publication rate can be maximised,
on average, just by writing as often as possible.  My friend even opined
that the writing doesn't really need to be about our specialisation all
the time. So long as it's scientific and it wouldn't be too embarrassing to
have it seen by strangers, that will do for starters.

This is similar to the sentiment expressed by Stephen King in *On Writing*: "If you want
to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and
write a lot. There's no way around these two things that I'm aware of,
no shortcut." And I wouldn't want to disagree with Stephen King. He
might respond by writing a story about my laptop getting possessed and
eating my hands. Then it would really happen, because that is one of
Stephen King's powers. And then I wouldn't be able to write anymore
because I wouldn't have any hands.

Anyway, at first I was kind of skeptical about whether it was really possible
for mere mortals such as myself to write all that much. I took
my friend's words as encouragement to kind of think about writing more,
but I hoped I could squirm my way out of it. I questioned whether it
would be optimal to write for an hour a day, or a day per week, or a
week per month. Probably more often than a month per year. Probably.

But at about the same time I encountered two suggestive links related to
the same ideas. The first was a summary of research by Robert Boice on the
[Tomorrow's Professor Mailing List](http://cgi.stanford.edu/~dept-ctl/tomprof/posting.php?ID=661)
which suggests that academics who commit to writing a little bit every
day end up being a lot more prolific than researchers who "binge write".
The other was a [Thesis Whisperer post](http://thesiswhisperer.com/shut-up-and-write/)
describing the notion of "Shut up and Write!" meetings.

With all this churning in my mind, it seemed natural to propose that we
segue the BGSA Journal Club with "Shut up and Write!" style pomodoro
sessions. The name "Writing Gym" only came later, after running our
first couple of pomodoro experiments. This wasn't really intended to 
distinguish ourselves from "Shut up and Write!" groups. It just seemed
that "Writing Gym" is a more succinct and accurate description.

The goal of Writing Gym is to help everyone both with their short-term writing goals
and also to acquire habits that will lead to more prolific research careers in the long-term.
Writing in a group helps with motivation (hence the word "gym"), and we
can also share ideas about what sorts of things to write and how to
become better writers.

There is no expectation that writing at Writing Gym should be bioinformatics specific.
It probably doesn't even have to be about science. There is no
expectation that anyone is writing towards some specific deadline,
although you can definitely use Writing Gym for that.
We encourage writing that could potentially be shared with others,
therefore no emails or facebook updates. (But, you know, it's not like we're going
to get angry and kick people out if they decide to quietly procrastinate.)
Examples of writing done so far have been preparing for blog posts,
writing conference abstracts and starting work on a submission for the
[Taming of Chance story competition](http://tamingofchance.vretta.com/).
If you get stuck for ideas, you could always summarise one of the papers from Journal Club.

Having now had a couple of sessions, it seems like people find them useful
and fun, so it is likely that Writing Gym will become an ongoing activity
with BGSA. Every second week we have Journal Club, and in the off weeks,
Writing Gym. The format and atmosphere (and people) are mostly the same
between the two. Like Journal Club, Writing Gym is an informal breakfast
event at Dr Dax on Royal Pde, Parkville, at 08:00AM Tuesdays.
First, we chow down and drink coffee and chit-chat for a while. When everyone
has arrived and more or less finished stuffing their face, we start by going around
the table and nominating our intended writing topics. Then we get stuck
into the half-hour pomodoro sesh. (Well, after ordering more coffee first. This is important.)
When the half-hour is up, we go around the table
again and describe whether we had any success. No one cares if someone
doesn't accomplish a lot: better luck next time!

Where it goes from here remains to be seen. Ideas on new things to try
would always be welcome. Maybe it wouldn't hurt to precede the pomodoro
sessions with micro-workshops, short discussions on things such as good
writing style, document-writing languages such as LaTeX or Markdown,
why text-editors are better than word processors,
and how best to use git to version control a document written in natural language?
But such things would depend on the
interests and goals of those attending, and whether it would get in the
way of drinking coffee while defending our hands from possessed laptops.
